# Overview
- This project used Timedistributed + Conv to train a model predicting human actions

# Dataset
- I use UCF50 dataset, which contains 50 actions, but in this project, i just used 4 actions to facilitate the training process (feel free to choose any actions you want)
- You can download the dataset [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.rar)

# Result
- You can watch the 'Result Video.mp4' to know more about the model's result (it's quite good)
- Loss and Accuracy on 30 epochs:
